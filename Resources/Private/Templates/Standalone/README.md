# Usage

this is the place for templates you include directly

a good example are our JS-Globals:

    headerData {
        ### Javascript-Globals -partly filled with TS
        20 = FLUIDTEMPLATE
        20 {
            file = EXT:theme/Resources/Private/Templates/Standalone/JavascriptGlobals.html
        }
    }
